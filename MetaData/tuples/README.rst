Definition of published PAT Tuples
==================================

Each PAT tuple production should exists as a .txt file in this directory.
Just add the samples as they finish to the .txt file, and the run ``make``.

Produces a .json file with a mapping from PAT dataset -> AOD dataset,
and a .rst file with a nice ASCII table.
